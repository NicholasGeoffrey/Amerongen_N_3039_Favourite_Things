# Nic Amerongen's Favourite Things
An app showcasing an introduction to a couple of my favourite things, using dynamic elements to present further details pulled from objects in a json library.

# Installation
npm install

# Usage
Click on one of the 3 previews to be presented with further details and a related image.

# Dev Path
-Collect Favourite Things for use and organize elements into mutual categories <br>
-these mutual categories will be useful to store each unique piece of info to each object as the same dataset <br>
-now decide how an html template will be structured to present all the 'Things' in a uniform manner <br>
-set up template with elements to coincide with the objects in the json file <br>
-populate json file <br>
-build user experience around clicking header for each 'Thing' to see further details <br>
-javascript will feature a similar function as the Bootcamp js, populating the template from an array but instead of it being in-line as a const it will pull the data from the json file
